## Introduction

The Task Management System is a web-based application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, including functionalities to create new tasks, retrieve all tasks, fetch a single task by its ID, update tasks, and delete tasks.

## Features

- Create new tasks with details such as title, description, status, and due date.
- Retrieve a list of all tasks.
- Fetch details of a specific task using its unique identifier (ID).
- Update task details, including title, description, status, and due date.
- Delete tasks by their ID.
